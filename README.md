Welcome

To have a great time clone down this repo and **cd** into the _CATWALK_ directory.

Once there, run `npm install`.
Cool, now you have all the dependencies you'll need.

To start up yer dev environs:
you must have "tmux" installed
Run`chmod +x serve.sh`.
Now run `npm run serve`.

Enjoy the SYMPL lifestyle.
